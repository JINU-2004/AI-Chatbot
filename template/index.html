*** The base website HTML/CSS was cloned from our college’s original website only for academic and demonstration purposes.

*** Therefore, the actual website files are not included in this public repository.
*** Follow the steps below to create chatbot .

-> 💬 To create a hovering chatbot on a website, start by adding a floating chat icon or button, typically positioned at the bottom-right corner of the page. 
-> 🪟 When clicked, this button should open a small chat window overlay that allows users to type and send messages. 
-> 🎨 The chatbot interface can be styled using HTML and CSS to appear as a sleek, minimal window that doesn’t interfere with the main content.
-> ⚙️ JavaScript is used to control the chatbot’s visibility and handle user interactions.
-> 🤖 For AI-powered responses, the chatbot can be connected to a backend service like Flask that communicates with a language model such as Google Gemini.
-> 🌐 This setup creates an interactive, user-friendly chatbot that seamlessly hovers over any website without altering its main structure.
